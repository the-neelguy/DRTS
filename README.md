# DRTS
This is Distributed Real Time System Project

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project is built using Python and Arduino.

This project is called Jarvis where an AI Assistant is built using Python which can do all sorts of activities like playing a song, reading news, searching web, telling a joke etc. This assistant was then combined with hardware using some sensors like DHT22 which was used to measure the temperature and humidity of a human body and a Pulse Sensor which was used to monitor the heartbeat of the user. Using these hardware sensors, the AI Assistant was able to measure the vitals of the user in real time and send the data to the user after analyzing.
